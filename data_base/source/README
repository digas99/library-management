It is needed for you to use the json-simple-1.1.jar library to compile the class DataBaseInitializer.
It is situated on the root folder, in a folder named lib.

Changing CLASSPATH localy in the terminal:
$ export CLASSPATH=.:/path/to/this/folder/library-management/lib/json-simple-1.1.jar

Compiling without changing the CLASSPATH of the terminal:
$ javac -cp /path/to/this/folder/library-management/lib/json-simple-1.1.jar *.java
